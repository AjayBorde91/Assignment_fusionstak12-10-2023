Assignment Documentation: Login and Registration Form with JWT Token

Introduction
This documentation provides instructions on how to create a web application that includes a
login and registration form using JWT token-based authentication. The application consists of
two separate parts: an Angular 16.0.0 frontend and a .NET Core 6.0.0 backend. The frontend
communicates with the backend API to handle user authentication, registration, and user
display

Prerequisites
 Node.js
 Angular CLI 16.0
 .NET Core SDK 6
 SQL Server

NuGet Package Installed :
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer 6.0.11
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore 7.0.10
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 7.0.10
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools 7.0.10


Steps to be perform:
Step 1: Create Angular Application
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired directory.
2. Run the following command to create a new Angular application:

Step 2: Create .NET Core Application
1. Navigate to the "angular-app" directory.
2. Create components for login, registration, and user display using Angular CLI commands.
3. Set up Angular routing for the different pages.

Step 3: Set Up .NET Core Application
1. Navigate to the "dotnet-core-app" directory.
2. Create controllers and actions for user authentication, registration, and user retrieval.
User Authentication and Registration/Sign Up

Login Page
1. Create a login component in Angular.
2. Implement a form with user name and password input fields.
3. Validate the form inputs, including password and user email.

Registration/SignUp Page
1. Create a registration component in Angular.
2. Implement a form with user registration fields (e.g., user name, email, password).
3. Validate the form inputs, including password and email.
4. Use Angular services to call the .NET Core API to store user registration information.

User Display and Logout
User Display Grid
1. Create a user display component in Angular.
2. Use Angular services to call the .NET Core API to retrieve user information.
3. Display the list of registered users in a grid format.

Logout Functionality
1. Implement a logout functionality.
2. Upon clicking the logout button, clear the session and redirect to the login screen.

Backend Integration
1. Implement JWT token-based authentication in the .NET Core application.
2. Configure CORS to allow requests from the Angular frontend.
3. Create API controllers to handle user authentication, registration, and user retrieval.
4. Store user information in an SQL database.
